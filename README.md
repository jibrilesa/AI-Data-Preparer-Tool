# AI DATA PREPARER TOOL

## Data Preparer to crawl keywords in Web sites

## AI Data Preparer for integration into Azure Machine Learning


## What is this?
The AI Data Preparer Tool is a robust solution designed to assist industries in need of an efficient web crawler that gathers categorized data from the internet using specified keywords. This SaaS web data integration (WDI) platform is capable of transforming unstructured web data into a structured format. It achieves this by extracting, preparing, and integrating web data into Azure Machine Learning models.

The tool provides a visual environment for automating the workflow of extracting and transforming web data. After the target website URL is specified, the web data extraction module offers a visual environment for designing automated workflows to harvest data. This goes beyond traditional HTML/XML parsing of static content by automating user interactions, thereby accessing data that might not be immediately visible. Once the data is extracted, the software offers comprehensive data preparation capabilities for harmonizing and cleansing the web data.

For consuming the results, the AI Data Preparer Tool provides several options. It has its own visualization and dashboarding module to assist criminal investigators in gaining the insights they need. Additionally, it provides APIs that offer full access to all functionalities available on the platform, allowing for direct integration of web data.

The AI Data Preparer Tool is capable of crawling ten million links and scraping one million links per month using workers. Furthermore, it has the potential to exceed this number if tested under standard cloud platforms. This makes it a powerful tool for industries that rely heavily on web data for their operations.
